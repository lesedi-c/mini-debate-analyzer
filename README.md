# ðŸ§  Mini Debate Analyzer

A lightweight, motion-aware debate prep tool built with Python and Streamlit.

This tool helps debaters quickly break down and prep motions by identifying:
- Motion type (policy, evaluative, actor-based)
- Strategic framing questions
- Core frameworks and tensions
- Claim starters and real-world examples

> Ideal for WSDC, BP, Worlds format, or fast prep practice rounds.
